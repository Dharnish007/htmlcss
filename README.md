# ReplicaAPI Python Script for JMeter Data Upload

This Python script utilizes the Replica API to upload JMeter performance test data to the Replica database. The uploaded data is extracted from a CSV file generated by JMeter and is pushed into the Replica Database. Once the data is available in the database, it is ready for creating dashboards accordingly.

Sample dashboards after uploading the data to the Replica database are specified below:

- API LoadTest: [API LoadTest Dashboard](https://ui.headspin.io/dashboards/3c-dC0cSz)
- Https LoadTest: [LoadTest Dashboard](https://ui.headspin.io/dashboards/Erlhjb5Iz)

Review the dashboards to visualize and analyze the performance test data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed (version 3.x recommended)
- Required Python libraries (`requests`, `json`, `os`, `csv`, `traceback`, `threading`)
- Make sure to specify your access token in line number 47.

Install the libraries using:

```bash
pip install requests
```
